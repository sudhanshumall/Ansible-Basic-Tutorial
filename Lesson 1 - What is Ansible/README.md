## What is Ansible

- Ansible is an open-source configuration management, software provisioning and application deployment tool which helps you automate your application deployment and IT infrastructure

- Ansible uses "Push" model and hence no agent is required to be installed on the target node and hence the reason why Ansible is popular

- Ansible uses SSH to connect to the servers and run your tasks you want to perform

- Ansible applies the changes to your system to achieve the desired state

- It allows you to control and configure your nodes from a single machine called Ansible Control Server

- In simple words, you can say that Ansible is simple, very powerful and agentless
