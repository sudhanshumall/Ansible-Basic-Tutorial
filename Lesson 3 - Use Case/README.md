## Ansible use cases

```
Provisioning : Ansible helps you create new infrastructure on any cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP etc.

Configuration Management : It is a powerful configuration management tool for deploying software packages and monitoring your remote machine.

App Deployment : Application deployment is one of the another feature of the ansible where you can deploy your applications across multiple infrastructure.

Continuous Delivery : Ansible provides an easy way to automatically deploy your application. Your continious integration tool (eg. Jenkins) can be used to trigger run your application test cases and automatically trigger the deployment if test cases are passed.

Security and Compliance : Ansible allows you to define your systems security policies across all the target nodes. (Mostly used by DevSecOps)
