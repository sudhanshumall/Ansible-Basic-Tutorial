## What is Ansible Playbook

- Paybooks are YAML files where Ansible code is written

- Playbooks can contain single or multiple plays

- Plays can contain single or multiple tasks where user defines the set the actions to be performed on the target nodes

- Extension of the YAML files should be either **.yaml** or **.yml**

- YAML is indentation sensitive and hence you should be little careful

**Example :**

```
1. running a command on single or N number of target node
2. restarting any service on multiple target node
3. deploying number of VMâ€™s on the Public/Private cloud
4. installing and configuring software's on the target node
5. setting up webserver or db server on multiple nodes
and many more
```
